# 🤔 Description
In this project, I re-implement a few container types of the C++ standard template library.
I have to comply with the C++98 standard, so any later feature of the containers *MUST NOT* be implemented, but every C++98 feature (even deprecated ones) is expected.

## Mandatory part
Implement the following containers and turn in the necessary <container>.hpp files:
  - vector
  - map
  - stack : </br>
    It will use your vector class as default underlying container. But it must still be compatible with other containers, the STL ones included.
    
You also have to implement:
  - iterators_traits
  - reverse_iterator
  - enable_if
  - is_integral
  - equal and/or lexicographical_compare
  - std::pair
  - std::make_pair
